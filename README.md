# RBMC

TODO: ready to be reconstructed.

The older version is [MIRV](https://github.com/zhuyutian57/RBMC/tree/85bb1e0be607d49069a385d9ff52ba51b452668a)

<!-- **RBMC** is a Bounded Model Checker for Rust based on [Stable MIR](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-stable-mir). It is still under development. We aim to develop a verifier for the memory safety in Rust.

## Installation

We recommend using `x.py` to build and install the binary tools. Alternatively, you can follow the standard installation instructions.

## Binary

We provide two binary tools, `rbmc` and `cargo-rbmc`. `rbmc` is a wrapper of Rust. It will handle the commands and run the compiler. After compiling, `rbmc` will start verifying the `.rs` by running BMC as a callback function of rustc. More details are shown by `-h`. `cargo-rbmc` is used for a project. `cargo-rbmc` will build the project by using `rbmc` as the compiler. It is still under development.

## Rustc

`RBMC` relies on `nightly-2025-03-02` rustc. The library of the nightly toolchain should be set before using our tool. We recommend using a temporary terminal and exporting the library by
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
in the root of `RBMC`.  -->
